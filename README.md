# chat_room1
This repository is about a multi-room chat application using Express.js for the back-end purpose, MongoDB for the database and HTML5, CSS3, React.js and Semantic UI for the front-end purpose. A multi-room chat application where multiple users can use login and create a room and can chat. Each time a logged in user of a particular room sends a message, the database experiences a change and then the database sends a signal to the other logged in members of that particular room and a change is reflected on the user side.
